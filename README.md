Project: Invisible String

Elevator pitch: Form a new habit using one simple application

Languages: HTML, CSS

## Inspiration
The inspiration behind Invisible String comes from Ashley's childhood dance instructor. Ginny always tell the dancers to be mindful of their posture, painting the picture with a striking metaphor, "there is an invisible string from the base of your spine to the top of your head- act like it is being pulled taunt." Shoulders would creak back and chins would tip up on the simple and seemingly cryptic command of **"invisible string, girls!"**

Fast forward to 2018, and Ashley oft forgets about her invisible string. Her posture is _terrible_. She thought that there should be an application that would send random reminders to her phone so she would be caught unaware and hopefully learn the habit, but most habit apps seemed so niche- one for watering plants, another here for going to the gym.

The team saw a benefit to a habit application that could be customized to the user's goals, be it posture, drinking water, or keeping your thoughts positive throughout the day. Combined with yesteryear's method of remembering something important, tying a string to one's finger, Invisible String was born.

## What it does
Invisible String allows a user to select from a set list of suggested **habits** or create their own, set the **frequency** of the (random, constrained by a time frame) push notification and badge reminders, select a custom **color** of string, and watch their habit journey through **data visualization** of a mess of tangled yarn transforming into a neat, rolled ball and once more transforming into a surprise-shaped string art! When done, add the completed art to your Trophy Case and begin all over again!

## How we built it
Though we attempted to learn from 0-60mph Meteor and Angular, we decided to create our well-prototyped and researched idea's first alpha demo with HTML and CSS.
